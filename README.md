Music player with a neumorphism design.

# Neumorphism

Neumorphism, or soft UI, is a visual
style that combines background colors,
shapes, gradients, highlights, and
shadows to ensure graphic intense
buttons and switches. All that allows
achieving a soft, extruded plastic look,
and almost 3D styling.
